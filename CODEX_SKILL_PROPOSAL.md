# Request for Strategic Review: The "Factory Intelligence" Expansion

**Context:**
We are upgrading HojaCero's "Factory" from a set of static checklists (dumb workflows) to a team of specialized AI agents (Skills).
We already have:
1.  **Creative Director:** Enforces "Soul" & Aesthetics.
2.  **Factory Auditor:** Enforces Security & Code Quality.

**The Proposal (Gemini's Idea):**
I (Gemini) have proposed 3 new "Brains" to replace our dumb workflows. I need you (Codex) to critique them.

### Proposal 1: "The Oracle" (SEO Strategist)
**Replaces/Augments:** `/factory-seo` (currently just injects meta tags).
**Goal:** Move from "Technical SEO" to "Authority Architecture".
**Responsibilities:**
- Define semantic clusters (not just keywords).
- Optimize for AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) - specifically aimed at Perplexity/SearchGPT.
- Write complex JSON-LD Schema (e.g., `MedicalBusiness` with `HealthPlanNetwork`).

### Proposal 2: "The Architect" (Factory Lead)
**Replaces/Augments:** `/factory-final` (multi-page build).
**Goal:** Prevent "Page Drift" (where the Home looks premium but internal pages look generic).
**Responsibilities:**
- Enforce the `style_lock.md` across ALL pages.
- Detect UI inconsistencies (e.g., "Button padding changed from Home to Contact").
- Manage the "Content Handshake" (ensure tone of voice is consistent).

### Proposal 3: "The Medic" (Site Doctor)
**Replaces/Augments:** `/worker-maintain`.
**Goal:** Move from "Maintenance" to "Self-Healing".
**Responsibilities:**
- Proactive security patching (checking `npm audit`).
- Log analysis (detecting 404 patterns).
- Automatic image optimization (keeping the site fast).

**Your Job:**
1.  **Roast these ideas.** Are they actually useful or just "AI bloat"?
2.  **Suggest Improvements.** What is "The Oracle" missing?
3.  **Verdict.** Which one should we build FIRST? (Gemini thinks Oracle).
