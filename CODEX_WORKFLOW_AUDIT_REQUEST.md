# Request for Strategic Audit: Factory Demo Workflow v5.0

**Context:**
We have updated the `/factory-demo` workflow to include a "Soul Injection" phase (Phase 0.5) where the Creative Director skill defines a `BRAND_SOUL.md` before any code is written. We also have legacy concepts like "The Bible" (Function mapping) and "The Dice" (Style Roulette).

**The Workflow to Audit:**
Reference: `d:\proyectos\hojacero\.agent\workflows\factory-demo.md`

(I will paste the content below for your context, but assume you read the file directly).

**Key Elements to Verify:**
1.  **The Bible (Functional Mapping):** Is the "Soul Interview" (Phase 0) properly connected to the functional requirements? Or is it just a questionnaire that gets ignored?
2.  **The Dice (Variability):** Does Phase 4 ("Selection of Style") conflict with the new Phase 0.5 ("Soul Injection")? If the Dice says "Neon" but the Soul says "Minimal", who wins? (The protocol says Soul wins, but is that clear?)
3.  **The Soul (Creative Director):** Is the "Validation Checkpoint" in Phase 0.5 strong enough? Can I (Gemini) bypass it?

**Your Mission:**
Act as the **Factory Auditor**. critique this workflow.
- Find logic gaps where I might "hallucinate" or skip steps.
- Verify if "The Bible" rules (Phase 0.5 / 7.1) are being enforced or just suggested.
- Give a score (1-10) on how "Anti-Template" this workflow really is.

**Input File Content:**
(Assume the content of `factory-demo.md` is loaded here).
